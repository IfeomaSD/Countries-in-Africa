        Mozambique is a southern African nation whose long Indian Ocean coastline is dotted with popular beaches like
        Tofo, as well as offshore marine parks.
      In the Quirimbas Archipelago, a 250km stretch of coral islands, mangrove-covered Ibo Island has colonial-era
        ruins surviving from a period of Portuguese rule.
        The Bazaruto Archipelago farther south has reefs which protect rare marine life including dugongs.
