    <h3>Welcome to The Gambia!</h3>
    <p>The Gambia is the smallest country in mainland Africa and is situated in Western Africa, surrounded completely by Senegal. It’s known for having an extremely unique boundary, which was set mostly by a 20 to 30-mile buffer along the Gambia River.</p>

    <p>lso unique to the country is that they formally include “The” in their country name. The only other country that does the same is The Bahamas. The Gambia is completely surrounded geographically by the country of Senegal with approximately 80 kilometers (50 miles) of coastline with the North Atlantic Ocean.</p>
