    <h3>Welcome to Western Sahara!</h3>
    <p>Western Sahara is a disputed territory along the northwest coast of Africa. While Morocco administers about 80% of the region, the partially-recognized Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic administers the remaining one-fifth of Western Sahara.</p>

    <p>The claimed capital is the largest city in Western Sahara, El Aai√∫n. But Tifariti is the temporary (de facto) capital close to its border with Mauritania. Altogether, it borders 3 nations including Morocco to the north, Algeria to the east, and Mauritania to the south.</p>
