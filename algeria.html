    <h3>Welcome to Algeria!</h3>
    <p>Algeria, large, predominantly Muslim country of North Africa. From the Mediterranean coast, along which most of its people live, Algeria extends southward deep into the heart of the Sahara, a forbidding desert where Earth’s hottest surface temperatures have been recorded and which constitutes more than four-fifths of the country’s area.</p>

    <p>Algeria borders Morocco to the northwest and Tunisia to the northeast. Libya and Niger are located to the northeast and southeast. Finally, Mali, Mauritania, and the Western Sahara region are to the southwest of Algeria.</p>
