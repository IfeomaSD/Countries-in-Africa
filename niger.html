    <h3>Welcome to Niger Republic!</h3>
    <p>Niger is a landlocked country located in Western Africa. It’s nicknamed the “Frying Pan of the World” because it’s one of the hottest countries with average temperatures from 17°C to 41°C.
    It’s not only its extreme heat, but it’s because the Sahara Desert covers 80% of its land. Niger lies between 12°N to 23°N above the equator so its climate is dry and hot.</p>
